## Code Notes

In order for the project to compile correctly, you correctly must use an R version < 4.0.
There are multiple packages that have yet to be updated for compatability with R 4.0 or higher.
If you try to run on an R version higher 3.6.3, we can't guarentee that our results will be reproduced.
